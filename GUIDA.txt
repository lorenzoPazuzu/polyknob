Windows that are in the page since the beginning in CONTROL PANEL are the ones explained in points 1)2)3):
1) The user has to choose the time signature of the first layer. The possible ones are:
4/4
3/4
9/8
7/8
5/4
3/2
Values of time signature should be given as an array of strings to the audio part in Tone.js

2) Then he has to choose the number of grains:
For TIME SIGNATURE=4/4 -> possible number of grains: [2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]
For TIME SIGNATURE=3/4 -> possible number of grains: [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
For TIME SIGNATURE=9/8 -> possible number of grains: [9, 18, 27, 36]
For TIME SIGNATURE=7/8 -> possible number of grains: [7, 14, 21, 28]
For TIME SIGNATURE=5/4 -> possible number of grains: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
For TIME SIGNATURE=3/2 -> possible number of grains: [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]
The chosen value for the number of grains has to be passed to the variable nGrain which gives the number of grains for the first layer.

3) There should be a window "Polyrhythm for the first layer: A/B" where A is the number of sides of the first shape 
and B is the number of sides of the second shape always for the first layer, C for the third and going on. 

            Points 4) and 5) should come up whenever the user adds a second layer:

4)Whenever the user adds another layer holding the "Layer button" he has to choose the new time signature from a third dropdown menu
to be passed to the audio engine and then the new number of grains from a forth dropdown menu (as before) which has to be given to nGrain2 
which right now is commented in Sketch.ts.

5) Window "Polymeter created: C:D" (similar to point 3) where C is the time signature of the first layer 
and D is the time signature of the second layer. For example, if I have chosen the time signature 4/4 for the first layer and 5/4 
for the second layer, i should get the notation "Polymeter created 4/4:5/4"
